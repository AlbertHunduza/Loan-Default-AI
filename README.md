# Loan-Approval-AI
# Loan Default Prediction Project

In the contemporary banking sector, the ability to accurately classify loans as safe or risky is of paramount importance. This classification enables financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate potential risks, and ensure the stability of their operations. The Loan Default Prediction project addresses this critical need by leveraging data exploration, machine learning techniques, and predictive modeling to classify loans based on their likelihood of default.

## Introduction

This project focuses on exploring loan data and developing a predictive model to classify loans as either safe or risky based on their likelihood to default. By accurately identifying risky loans, financial institutions can proactively manage potential defaults and minimize adverse impacts on their financial stability.

## Dataset Description

For a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its sources, please refer to the [`dataset_description.md`](dataset_description.md) file. This document outlines the details of the dataset and credits the original source.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis process is documented in the [`Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`](Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb) notebook. Through data visualization and exploration, we gain insights into the characteristics of loans and loanees, which inform subsequent preprocessing and modeling steps.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing and feature engineering were carried out using the [`preprocessor.py`](preprocessor.py) script. This step is crucial for cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning. 

## Binary Classification Model

The heart of this project lies in the [`binary_classification_model.ipynb`](binary_classification_model.ipynb) notebook. In this notebook, we trained a binary classification model using PyTorch with GPU acceleration. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of over 90%. Visual representations of the loss curves can be found in the [`accuracy.png`](accuracy.png) and [`loss.png`](loss.png) files.

## Future Work

Continuing the journey, future work involves optimizing the model further to achieve even higher accuracy, potentially approaching 100%. Additionally, there's an exciting opportunity to deploy the trained model to a web dashboard, enabling real-time predictions and enhanced decision-making for loan classification.
